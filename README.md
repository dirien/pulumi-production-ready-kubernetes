- [Chapter 1 - Containerize an Application](./01-app-setup.md)

### Prerequisites

You will need to install these tools in order to complete this workshop:

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- [Pulumi Account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup) - this optional, but convenient to handle the state of the different
  stacks.
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Scaleway CLI](https://www.scaleway.com/en/cli/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [A GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/)

There is also a [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file in this repository which you can use to spin
up a `devcontainer` with all the tools installed. Highly recommended if you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) or
[DevPods](https://devpod.sh).
